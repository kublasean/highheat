    <h1 style="max-width: 60%;">Since meeting at the University of Tennessee, we've been crafting our sound for the better part of a decade.</h1>
    <p style="max-width: 60%;">
        That sound is inspired by the craftsmanship of the classic rock gods of old and blended with the modern, poignant storytelling of indie rock. 
        The wide range of our influences leads us to write songs that intersperse blazing guitar solos and dynamic unison breakdowns with catchy choruses and meaningful lyrics. 
        It’s controlled chaos that feels raw and genuine without sacrificing quality.

                “High Heat is a young band with a lot of potential
                that has that gritty garage-rock vibe a little like
                early Cage.”
