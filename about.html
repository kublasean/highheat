   In early 2015, from the tiny concrete music room of a dorm at the University of Tennessee came a thunderous sound. A passerby doing laundry poked their head in to listen. When the sound had ended, they exclaimed, “Wow. You guys are… loud.”

   In the years since, High Heat has become much more than another loud rock band. They've honed their craft in dingy bars, house parties, outdoor festivals, and established venues. They’ve developed an identity as an energetic rock band that gives their all every time they take the stage.

   High Heat draws inspiration from the garage rock revival of the late 2000s; including The Strokes, The White Stripes, and Cage the Elephant. Rumbling bass and drums, growling guitars with wailing solos, and thoughtful lyrics comprise High Heat’s sound. High Heat harks back to an era without live tracks, triggered drums, and neatly packaged pitch-perfect vocals. What you hear at a show comes straight from their instruments and their life experiences: authentic, unfiltered, original rock ‘n’ roll.
